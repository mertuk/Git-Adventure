    <h1> Git Quiz  </h1>
    <h4> What is Git and why is it so important? </h4>
    <p>  Git is a free and open-source version control system used to handle small to very large projects efficiently. Git is 
         used to tracking changes in the source code, enabling multiple developers to work together on non-linear development.
        </p>
    <h4> What's a branch and why do we create them?  </h4>
    <p>  A branch is a version of the repository that diverges from the main working project. We create branches in order to 
         isolate specific Git commits from the rest of our main Git history. If our main Git history is based on the master branch, 
         we can create a separate Git branch in order to develop new features and merge them later on. </p>
    <h4> What's the working tree?  </h4>
    <p>  The working tree is the set of all files and folders a developer can add, edit, rename and delete during application 
         development. </p>
    <h4> What's the staging area?  </h4>
    <p>  The staging area can be described as a preview of your next commit. When you create a git commit, Git takes changes that
         are in the staging area and make them as a new commit. You are allowed to add and remove changes from the staging area. 
         The staging area can be considered as a real area where git stores the changes. </p>
    <h4> What's the command to retrieve the latest version of your files from the remote serve?  </h4>
    <p>  Git pull  </p>
